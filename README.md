# Video blob component

Checkout `src/App.vue` and `src/components/BlobAnimation.vue` for the demo.

To see the preview, make sure you're at [the Code Sandbox view](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/mattattui/video-blob-demo/main). It'll take a bloody age to set up the first time, but if you've used it before, it'll load straight away.

If it's not showing on the right, then open up the CodeSandbox tools on the side toolbar (the icon's a rectangle with a > in it), and click "Run setup tasks".

The preview panel should update, but if not, it'll show a couple of buttons to "vite dev" and "preview". Use the former if you're doing any editing.
